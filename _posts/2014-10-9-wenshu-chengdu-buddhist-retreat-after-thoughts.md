## My interest in Buddhism
I've had a liking to Buddhist teachings for a couple of years now. Ever since reading `Relax` which promoted meditation has very significant benefits for health as well as piece of mind. Since meditation is a big part of Buddhism, I was naturally drawn towards it.

I've also been searching for meditation or Buddhist events to attend, as I felt it was difficult to understand the subject matter from just reading.

In Beijing, I attended the `Beijing Cultural` meditation evening event, which was a cool 300 RMB for an hour long guided meditation session. There is also the community-organised meditation and philosophy meetups - which are very good.

In Chengdu where I'm now living, I've been meaning to find local spiritual events to attend - and it's only until now that I have.

## Wenshu Monastary, Chengdu

Wenshu Monastary or Wenshuyuan(文殊院），is a large monastary in the north part of urban Chengdu.

It is very well organised, holding a number of events on through out the year. More on that later.

## Application process - Seriously?

As the event is over-subscribed, there is an application process to go through. Apparently the eventual selected attendees of 270  were filtered down from 900 odd applicants. When I received the phone call notifying of my selection, I felt great.

## First Impressions
Having taken half a day off to attend the start of the event, I made myself expectantly to Wenshu temple.

Inside the temple, directions towards the event hotel where we sign in and sleep are well sign posted. Walking up, seeing some of the other attendees already having swapped civilian clothes for the loose-fitting, white uniforms of the event, made me feel even more expectant.

..

To help usher 270 attendees were numerous volunteers(义工)，of which were split into two camps: group facilitators and general volunteers.

The group facilitators were our main contact of the event. They each managed a group of around 20 same-gendered attendees.


... talk about event itself ...

## Event after - Oh have I changed

I think it's a mark of a good event, or anything for that matter, if you've noticeably changed because of it.

Here's how the event has changed me:

- Zhi Hai (智海）Shifu's insightful talk, which included many parts on being present at the task on hand, or the people you're worth. It's made me realise how much benefit I got from regular meditation and motivated me to get back into a more regular and longer meditation practise.
- Silent meals at the Wenshu, even though initially feeling weird about it, it really grew on me after. Using meal time as a break  of the busyness of daily life. Eating in silence had a calming effect. I've been eating some of my meals in silence since, mainly breakfast and sometime evening meals if I'm eating alone. No mobile phones, no TV. It's like having an extra meditation session.
- Increased understanding of Buddhism. Before I liked meditation, and cautiously liked Buddhist teachings, but didn't understand it enough to appreciate just how relevant it is to daily life. It's full of 'tips & tricks', 'thinking hacks' and philosophy for living a better life. Who wouldn't want to learn more of that...!
